# 03-Machine-Learning-Atari-Games
# Task
Utilize neural networks to address challenges through reinforcement learning, leveraging the Deep Q-Network (DQN). DQN, unlike traditional approaches reliant on tables, represents the optimal action-value function using a neural network.

# Description
Embark on an exciting journey into the realm of Atari games, building on the power of deep learning! This project offers an exciting opportunity to delve into neural networks and expand your knowledge of deep learning.
